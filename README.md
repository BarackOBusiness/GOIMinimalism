# Getting Over It Minimalism
A mod that simplifies the visuals of playing Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy to the absolute maximum.
This mod is not compatible with any kind of other cosmetic customizer for very obvious reason.

To install, download a release from the [releases](https://github.com/BarackOBusiness/GOIMinimalism/releases) tab, then drop it into your game's BepInEx installation plugins folder.
If you don't have that, head to [BepInEx documentation](https://docs.bepinex.dev/articles/user_guide/installation/index.html) for installation instructions.
