This mod is not compatible with any kind of other cosmetic customizer for very obvious reason.

To install, download a release from the [releases](https://github.com/BarackOBusiness/GOIMinimalism/releases) tab, then drop it into your BepInEx installation's plugins folder.
If you don't have that, head to [BepInEx documentation](https://docs.bepinex.dev/articles/user_guide/installation/index.html) for installation instructions.

## Configuration
The mod takes 3 parameters, an accent color, foreground color, and background color.
The mountain is set to the foreground, the player and water is set to the accent, and the background is a flat solid color.

The file for editing these values can be found in the BepInEx installation's config folder, it is named `goi.ext.minimalism.cfg`.
